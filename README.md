# File Breaker
A simple CLI that 'corrupts' your files. It works by just adding fake binary to your files. Unless its a text file or any type of file that is text based it should succesfully corrupt it. 

## Installation
Just run (May require sudo or admin perms)
```
npm install -g file-breaker
```
